# gg (Generic Generics)

A Go library for the generic types that should be in the standard library, but aren't.
Currently, this includes [Option](./option/).
I may additional types like `Result`, `Either` or `Pair` if:

- there is a compelling usecase for myself, and
- an API can be built that is ergonomic in practice (this is the biggest reason why `Result` might never happen).
