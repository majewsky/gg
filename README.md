# gg (Generic Generics)

A Go library for the generic types that should be in the standard library, but aren't.
Currently, this includes [Option](./option/), but `Result` or `Either` could also be added once there is a compelling usecase for myself.

## No release?

This type relies on behavior that is being introduced in Go 1.24. The 1.0 release will be made as soon as Go 1.24 releases.
