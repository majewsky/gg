# Notes for contributors

This repository accepts contributions as follows:

- For new methods and functions, feel free to submit a PR right away.
- For entirely new types, or when adding library dependencies, please open an issue first to discuss the design.
- Generally, we dislike library dependencies in this house because every dependency means extra work from Dependabot.
